The Dangerous Flight

INCOMPLETE YET

#0. Intro

The Dangerous Flight is a game about airplanes fighting. You can drive
planes and let them shoot missles and enemies coming to you(in the later
versions). 

#1. Building

This game requires cmake, SDL and SDL_image to build.

Follow these steps to build on linux:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
...
> make
...

And to run it:
> cd ..
> ./build/DF

Or on windows, you can use VC++ to open DF.vcxproj, and build.

Notice that you must run the game in the dir which "res" in.

Enjoy!
